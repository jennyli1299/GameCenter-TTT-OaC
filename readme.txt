Hello there! In order to compile and execute my code, please use the following two commands:
1. javac GameController.java
2. java GameController

2. Playable Interface -> Interface for all things Playable. All classes which implement this interface must have play() and replay() methods
3. Board_Games_2P -> An abstract class for Two-Player Board Games which implements the Interface Playable
4. TTT -> Allows players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe
5. OaC -> Allows players to play a game of Order and Chaos
